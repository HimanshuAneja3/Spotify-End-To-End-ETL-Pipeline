# Spotify End-to-End ETL Pipeline

This project aims to create an ETL pipeline for extracting data from the Spotify API and storing it in a target location. The pipeline will handle the extraction of music-related data from Spotify, perform necessary transformations, and load the processed data into a specified storage location.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a robust and scalable ETL pipeline that can:

- Connect to the Spotify API securely.
- Extract relevant data (such as tracks, albums, artists, playlists).
- Transform the raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis and storage.
- Load the transformed data into a target location (e.g., database, data warehouse).
